# Ancestry_Voting_for_Sea_Urchins
These scripts were created to show how we were able to run Ancestry Voting in The Wray-McClay lab to identify developmental trajectories in Sea Urchins. We are extrimely grateful with Jonas Brandenburg who shared his orginal scripts with us.


This is an standalone R script to implement ancestry voting, as in Qiu et al (2022) > https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01018-x
